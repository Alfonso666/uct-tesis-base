Menendez, M., Mendez, F. J., and Losada, I. J. 2009. Forecasting seasonal to interannual variability in extreme sea levels. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1490–1496.A statistical model to predict the probability of certain extreme sea levels occurring is presented. The model uses a time-dependent generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution to fit monthly maxima series, and it is applied for a particular time-series record for the Atlantic Ocean (Newlyn, UK). The model permits the effects of seasonality, interannual variability, and secular trends to be identified and estimated in the probability distribution of extreme sea levels. These factors are parameterized as temporal functions (linear, quadratic, exponential, and periodic functions) or covariates (for instance, the North Atlantic Oscillation index), which automatically yield the best-fit model for the variability present in the data. A clear pattern of within-year variability and significant effects resulting from astronomical modulations (the nodal cycle and perigean tides) are detected. Modelling different time-scales helps to gain a better understanding of recent secular trends regarding extreme climate events, and it allows predictions to be made (for example, up to 2020) about the probability of the future occurrence of a particular sea level.},

More recent predictions (http://climatecommission.govspace.gov.au/files/2011/05/4108-CC-Science-Update-PRINT-CHANGES.pdf, 2011; Rahmstorf, 2007, 2010) have forecasted that sea level rises by 2100 will be higher than the 2007 projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_synthesis_report.htm, 2011), with projected sea level rises increasing from 18–59&#xa0;cm to 100&#xa0;cm. In this brief communication, the predictions of Rahmstorf (2007) are validated against the experimental evidence over a 20&#xa0;year period. The University of Colorado Sea Level satellite monitoring shows that the rate of rise of the sea level is not only well below the values computed in http://climatecommission.govspace.gov.au/files/2011/05/4108-CC-Science-Update-PRINT-CHANGES.pdf (2011) and Rahmstorf (2007, 2010), but actually reducing rather than increasing (http://sealevel.colorado.edu/, 2011b; 10,11). These results suggest that sea level predictions based solely on the presumed temperature evolution may fail to accurately predict the long term sea levels at the end of the century. "

Over these periods, the global mean sea level rose at rates of 1.7&#xa0;mm/yr and 3.2&#xa0;mm/yr respectively, as a result of both increase of ocean thermal expansion and land ice loss. The regional sea level variations, however, have been dominated by the thermal expansion factor over the last decades even though other factors like ocean salinity or the solid Earth's response to the last deglaciation can have played a role. We also present examples of total local sea level variations that include the global mean rise, the regional variability and vertical crustal motions, focusing on the tropical Pacific islands. Finally we address the future evolution of the global mean sea level under on-going warming climate and the associated regional variability. Expected impacts of future sea level rise are briefly presented. "

abstract = "A proper coastal management requires an accurate estimation of sea level trends locally and globally. It is claimed that the sea levels are rising following an exponential growth since the 1990s, and because of that coastal communities are facing huge challenges. Many local governments throughout Australia, including those on the coast, have responded to the various warnings about changes in climate and increases in sea levels by undertaking detailed climate change risk management exercises. These exercises, which use projections passed on by the relevant state bodies, are expensive, but still a fraction of the cost of the capital works that they recommend. Several councils have complained to an Australian Productivity Commission report on climate change adaptation they do not have the money for the capital works required. It is shown here that the exponential growth claim is not supported by any measurement of enough length and quality when properly analysed. The tide gauge results do not support the exponential growth theory. The projections by the relevant state bodies should therefore be revised by considering the measurements and not the models to compute the future sea level rises for the next 30 years following the same trend experienced over the last 30 years.
